The project `OCA/edi <https://github.com/OCA/edi>`__ provides modules to generate UBL and Factur-X invoices. This solution designed by OCA is an **alternative** to the solution provided by Odoo S.A. in the official addons (Community version), it is not a solution built above it.

As a consequence, before installing this module, you should uninstall the module *account_facturx* of Odoo S.A. The module *account_facturx* is an auto-install module, so it is probably installed by default on your Odoo.

If you want to generate Factur-X invoices, you should install the OCA module *account_invoice_factur-x* available on `OCA/edi <https://github.com/OCA/edi>`__.
