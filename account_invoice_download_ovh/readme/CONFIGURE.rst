To configure this module, you need to go to the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Import Vendor Bills > Download Bills* and create one entry per OVH Account. Select *OVH* as *Backend*.

If you don't already have the required parameters to access the OVH API (Application key, Application secret and Consumer key) with the right access level on the APIs used by this module, use the wizard *Generate OVH API Credentials* that will be proposed once you have selected OVH as Backend.
