This module adds a weboob backend to the *account_invoice_download* module. `Weboob <http://weboob.org/>`_ (*Web Outside of Browsers*) is an opensource project that provides several applications to interact with websites without requiring to open them in a Web browser. It connects to websites via web-scrapping or APIs. Weboob provides `several APIs <http://dev.weboob.org/api/capabilities/index.html>`_ per topic: banking, job, cinema, weather, radio, etc. This Odoo module uses the *bill* API of Weboob to automatically download invoices from the websites of our suppliers and import them as vendors bills in Odoo. Weboob has a lot of `modules <http://weboob.org/modules>`_ (one per supported website), but only a small part of those modules provide the *bill* API. As of August 2018, Weboob has 26 modules that provide the *bill* API. Weboob welcomes the contribution of additionnal modules to support more websites. The weboob project was started by french developers, so the majority of modules to download invoices are for french suppliers (EDF, Orange, Bouygues Telecom, Free, etc.), but you are invited to develop and contribute new Weboob modules to add support for the main suppliers of your country. The `developer documentation <http://dev.weboob.org/>`_ of Weboob has a section named *Write a new module*!
