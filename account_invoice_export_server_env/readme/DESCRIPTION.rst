Server environment for Account Invoice Export
=============================================

This module is based on the `server_environment` module to use files for
configuration. So we can have a different configuration for each

    [transmit_method.transmition_method_code]
    destination_pwd: password,
    destination_user: user,
    destination_url: url,
