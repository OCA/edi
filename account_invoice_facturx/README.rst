With this module, the PDF customer invoices and refunds generated by the
Qweb reporting engine of Odoo will comply with the
`Factur-X <http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/>`__ standard. The Factur-X
standard is an e-invoicing standard for France and Germany released on
December 31st 2017. In Germany, it is also known as the `ZUGFeRD
2.0 <http://www.ferd-net.de/aktuelles/meldungen/verabschiedung-zugferd-2.0_profil-en16931.html/>`__
standard. This standard is based on
`CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`__
(Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the
ZUGFeRD/Factur-X standard is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice
to carry structured information about the invoice. So, with a
ZUGFeRD/Factur-X PDF invoice:

-  no need to change your habbits and those of your customers: you can
   still send your PDF invoices by email as usual.
-  customers equiped with a modern accouting software will be able to
   import the invoice automatically as supplier invoice by taking
   advantage of the embedded XML file,
-  customers with an ancient accounting software will just open the PDF
   file with their PDF reader and manually encode the document as
   supplier invoice in their accounting software.

Installation
============

This module requires a recent version of the Python library
`factur-x <https://github.com/akretion/factur-x>`__ developped by
Akretion. Note that the factur-x library depends on PyPDF2 for the
low-level PDF manipulation. To install it, run:

::

   sudo pip3 install --upgrade factur-x

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings*, check these options:

-  *XML Format embedded in PDF invoice*: if you want to generate
   Factur-X invoices, this option must be set to *Factur-X (CII)*
-  the *Factur-X Level*: unless you have a good reason, you should keep
   the default value *EN 16931 (Comfort)*
-  *Factur-X Refund Type*: choose the type of the XML invoice for
   customer refunds (keep the default value if you are not familiar with
   this setting).
