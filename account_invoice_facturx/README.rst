With this module, the PDF customer invoices and refunds generated by the Qweb reporting engine of Odoo will comply with the `Factur-X <http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/>`__ standard. The Factur-X standard is an e-invoicing standard for France and Germany released on December 31st 2017. In Germany, it is also known as the `ZUGFeRD 2.0 <http://www.ferd-net.de/aktuelles/meldungen/verabschiedung-zugferd-2.0_profil-en16931.html/>`_ standard. This standard is based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the ZUGFeRD/Factur-X standard is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice to carry structured information about the invoice. So, with a ZUGFeRD/Factur-X PDF invoice:

* no need to change your habbits and those of your customers: you can still send your PDF invoices by email as usual.
* customers equiped with a modern accouting software will be able to import the invoice automatically as supplier invoice by taking advantage of the embedded XML file,
* customers with an ancient accounting software will just open the PDF file with their PDF reader and manually encode the document as supplier invoice in their accounting software.

Installation
============

This module requires a recent version of the Python library `factur-x <https://github.com/akretion/factur-x>`__ developped by Akretion. Note that the factur-x library depends on PyPDF2 for the low-level PDF manipulation. To install it, run:

.. code::

  sudo pip3 install --upgrade factur-x

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings*, check these options:

* *XML Format embedded in PDF invoice*: if you want to generate Factur-X invoices, this option must be set to *Factur-X (CII)*
* the *Factur-X Level*: unless you have a good reason, you should keep the default value *EN 16931 (Comfort)*
* *Factur-X Refund Type*: choose the type of the XML invoice for customer refunds (keep the default value if you are not familiar with this setting).
