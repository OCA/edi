With this module, the PDF customer invoices and refunds generated by the
Qweb reporting engine of Odoo will comply with the
[Factur-X](http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/) standard. The Factur-X
standard is an e-invoicing standard for France and Germany released on
December 31st 2017. In Germany, it is also known as the [ZUGFeRD
2.0](http://www.ferd-net.de/aktuelles/meldungen/verabschiedung-zugferd-2.0_profil-en16931.html/)
standard. This standard is based on
[CII](http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm)
(Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the
ZUGFeRD/Factur-X standard is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice
to carry structured information about the invoice. So, with a
ZUGFeRD/Factur-X PDF invoice:

- no need to change your habbits and those of your customers: you can
  still send your PDF invoices by email as usual.
- customers equiped with a modern accouting software will be able to
  import the invoice automatically as supplier invoice by taking
  advantage of the embedded XML file,
- customers with an ancient accounting software will just open the PDF
  file with their PDF reader and manually encode the document as
  supplier invoice in their accounting software.
