With this module, the PDF customer invoices and refunds generated by the Qweb reporting engine of Odoo will comply with the `Factur-X <http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/>`__ standard. The Factur-X standard is an e-invoicing standard for France and Germany released on December 31st 2017. In Germany, it is also known as the `ZUGFeRD 2.0 <http://www.ferd-net.de/aktuelles/meldungen/verabschiedung-zugferd-2.0_profil-en16931.html/>`_ standard. This standard is based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the ZUGFeRD/Factur-X standard is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice to carry structured information about the invoice. So, with a ZUGFeRD/Factur-X PDF invoice:

* no need to change your habbits and those of your customers: you can still send your PDF invoices by email as usual.
* customers equiped with a modern accouting software will be able to import the invoice automatically as supplier invoice by taking advantage of the embedded XML file,
* customers with an ancient accounting software will just open the PDF file with their PDF reader and manually encode the document as supplier invoice in their accounting software.
