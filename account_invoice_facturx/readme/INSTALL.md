**WARNING**: there is an alternative implementation of Factur-X in the module **account_edi_ubl_cii** of the official addons. If both modules are installed, the XML embedded in the PDF is the XML generated by the module **account_edi_ubl_cii**. To avoid that, you need to uninstall the module **account_edi_ubl_cii**.

This module requires a recent version of the Python library
[factur-x](https://github.com/akretion/factur-x) developped by Akretion.
Note that the factur-x library depends on PyPDF2 for the low-level PDF
manipulation. To install it, run:

``` 
pip3 install --upgrade factur-x
```
