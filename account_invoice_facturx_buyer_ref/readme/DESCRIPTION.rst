Some companies are affected by country-specific regulations that require you to
set a BuyerReference in the FacturX data.

For instance, German Public Organizations will require that you set a Leitweg ID
when invoicing to them. This information needs to be set in the BuyerReference.

This requirement is not localization-specific because it affects all EU companies
invoicing that particular organization.

This module allows you to set on partners a Buyer Reference to be used on FacturX
invoices, complying with this regulation and potentially others of this kind.
