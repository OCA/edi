it is required to use this format for B2G invoices. Although the creation and
sending is managed in oca/l10n-spain, this module allows to import supplier
invoices into your system.

To use this module, go to the menu *Accounting > Purchases > Import Invoice* and upload a XSIG or XML invoice of your supplier.
