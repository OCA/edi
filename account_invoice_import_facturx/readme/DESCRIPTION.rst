This module is an extension of the module *account_invoice_import*: it adds the ability to import Factur-X 1.0 (i.e. ZUGFeRD 2.x) and ZUGFeRD 1.0 invoices. The `Factur-X <http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/>`_ standard is based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. A Factur-X invoice is a PDF invoice with an embedded XML file in CII format that carries structured information about the invoice.
