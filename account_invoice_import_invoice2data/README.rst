This module is an extension of the module *account_invoice_import*: it adds support for regular PDF invoices i.e. PDF invoice that don't have an embedded XML file. It uses the `invoice2data library <https://github.com/invoice-x/invoice2data>`_ which takes care of extracting the text of the PDF invoice, find an existing invoice template and execute the invoice template to extract the useful information from the invoice.

To know the full story behind the development of this module, read this `blog post <http://www.akretion.com/blog/akretions-christmas-present-for-the-odoo-community>`_.

More information for creating the templates can be found in `tutorial of the invoice2data library <https://github.com/invoice-x/invoice2data/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md>`_. The templates have to be created manually. An graphical template creator for odoo is a work in progress.

**WARNING**: an alternative module **account_invoice_import_simple_pdf** developped in July 2021 provides similar features but has one big advantage: the accountant can add support for a new vendor by himself, no more invoice templates which require technical skill. The module *account_invoice_import_simple_pdf* provides basic functionality, but does not support line level accounting.

Installation
============

This module requires the Python library *invoice2data* available on `Github <https://github.com/invoice-x/invoice2data>`_ with a version >= 0.2.74 (February 2018).

To install the latest version of this library, run:

.. code::

  sudo pip3 install --upgrade invoice2data

If you use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or higher, you can use the pdftotext version 0.41.0 that is packaged in the distribution:

.. code::

  sudo apt install poppler-utils

If you want the invoice2data library to support mixed-type pdf's or fallback on OCR if the PDF doesn't contain text (only a very small minority of PDF invoices are image-based and require OCR) like scanned receipts, you should also install `Ocrmypdf <https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF>`_

.. code::

  pip install -U ocrmypdf

If you want the invoice2data library to fallback on OCR if the PDF doesn't contain text (only a very small minority of PDF invoices are image-based and require OCR) like scanned receipts, you should also install `Imagemagick <https://www.imagemagick.org/>`_ (to get the *convert* utility to convert PDF to TIFF) and `Tesseract OCR <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract>`_ :

.. code::

  sudo apt install imagemagick tesseract-ocr

If you want to use custom invoice templates for the invoice2data lib (in addition to the templates provided by the invoice2data lib), you should add a line in your Odoo server configuration file such as:

.. code::

  invoice2data_templates_dir = /opt/invoice2data_local_templates

and store your invoice templates in YAML format (*.yml* extension) or json format in the directory that you have configured above. If you add invoice tempates in this directory, you don't have to restart Odoo, they will be used automatically on the next invoice import.

If you want to use only your custom invoice templates and ignore the templates provided by the invoice2data lib, you should have in your Odoo server configuration file:

.. code::

  invoice2data_templates_dir = /opt/invoice2data_local_templates
  invoice2data_exclude_built_in_templates = True

The yaml templates are loaded with [pyyaml](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml) which is a pure python implementation. (thus rather slow)
As an alternative json templates can be used. Which are natively better supported by python. The performance with yaml templates can be greatly increased **10x** by using [libyaml](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml)
It can be installed on most distributions by:

.. code::

  sudo apt-get libyaml-dev

French users should also install the module *l10n_fr_business_document_import* available in the `French localization <https://github.com/OCA/l10n-france/>`_.
Dutch users should also install the module *l10n_nl_business_document_import* available in the `Netherlands localization <https://github.com/OCA/l10n-netherlands/>`_.

Dependencies
============
| Name | Requirement | Installation | Description |
| -------------- | :---------: | :---------: | :-------------------------------------- |
| [invoice2data](https://github.com/invoice-x/invoice2data) | required | `pip install invoice2data` | The main dependency of this invoice import module |
| [poppler-utils](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) | required | `apt install poppler-utils` | The default Input-reader for the invoice2data library |
| [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) | required | `pip install dateparser` | Requirement for parsing the invoice dates, this requirement is likely already satisfied by odoo itself |
| [libyaml](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml) | optional | `apt install libyaml-dev` | Template loader, recomended to greatly speedup the loading of yaml templates |
| [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) | optional | `apt install imagemagick` | inputreader: Pre-processes the pdf before feeding it into tesseract-ocr |
| [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) | optional | `apt install tesseract-ocr` | inputreader: for ocr of image only pdf files |
| [tesseract-ocr- lang](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html) | optional | `apt install tesseract-ocr-` see documentation | inputreader: Language pack for tesseract ocr, greatly improves character detection |
| [ocrmypdf](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) | optional | `apt install ocrmypdf` | inputreader: For image only or mixed type pdf's. It uses tesseract-ocr under the hood, but provides optimalisations which greatly improves results |

Configuration
=============

Go to the form view of the supplier and configure it with the following parameters:

* the *VAT* is set (the VAT number is used by default when searching the supplier in the Odoo partner database)
* in the *Invoicing* tab, create an *Invoice Import Configuration*.

For the PDF invoice of your supplier that don't have an embedded XML file, you will have to create a `template file <https://github.com/invoice-x/invoice2data/tree/master/src/invoice2data/extract/templates>`_ in YAML format in the invoice2data Python library. It is quite easy to do ; if you are familiar with `regexp <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`_, it should not take more than 10 minutes for each supplier.

Here are some hints to help you add a template for your supplier:

* There is a `tutorial in the repo of the invoice2data library <https://github.com/invoice-x/invoice2data/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md>`_

* Take `Free SAS template file <https://github.com/invoice-x/invoice2data/blob/master/src/invoice2data/extract/templates/fr/fr.free.adsl-fiber.yml>`_ as an example. You will find a sample PDF invoice for this supplier under invoice2data/test/pdf/invoice_free_fiber_201507.pdf

* Try to run the invoice2data library manually on the sample invoice of Free:

.. code::

  % python -m invoice2data.main --debug invoice2data/test/pdf/invoice_free_fiber_201507.pdf

On the output, you will get first the text of the PDF, then some debug info on the parsing of the invoice and the regexps, and, on the last line, you will have the dict that contain the result of the parsing.

* if the VAT number of the supplier is present in the text of the PDF invoice, I think it's a good idea to use it as the keyword. It is good practice to add 2 other keywords: one for the language (for example, match on the word *Invoice* in the language of the invoice) and one for the currency, to match only the invoices of that supplier in this particular language and currency.

* the list of *fields* should contain the following entries:

  * 'vat' with the VAT number of the supplier (if the VAT number of the supplier is not in the text of PDF file, add a 'partner_name' key)
  * 'amount' ('amount' is the total amount with taxes)
  * 'amount_untaxed' or 'amount_tax' (one or the other, no need for both)
  * 'date': the date of the invoice
  * 'invoice_number'
  * 'date_due', if this information is available in the text of the PDF file.

The invoice2data library is quite powerfull. It supports multiple input methods (pdftotext, ocrmypdf, tesseract ocr, google cloud vision).
Even invoicelines can be imported and mapped to products in the database.
The invoice2data library does not have a strict standard on field names. This makes the module very flexible, but also hard to create re-usable templates.

If you want to make use of the advanced features, support for the following fields is implemented.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Implement support for lines with all tax included, used for some localizations like Switzerland or scanned receipts.
* An graphical template builder.

Known Issues
* The input module is hard coded to use pdftotext parser and as a fallback to tesseract.
* Creation of the templates is still quite hard.
* The addres and company specific fields are parsed. Meaning it is possible to import an invoice which is issued to another company than yours!
