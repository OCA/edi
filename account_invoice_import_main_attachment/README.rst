This module allows to import incoming invoices (vendor Bills) to be reveived by email,
wether or not an import configuration for the vendor has been created upfront.

Invoices can be imported from the main attachment received, as soon as an import defintion has been created for the vendor.

Configuration
=============

Go to the form view of the suppliers and configure it with the following parameters:

* Individual/Company: *Company*
* the *TIN* (i.e. VAT number) is set (the VAT number is used by default when searching the supplier in the Odoo partner database)
* in the *Accounting* tab, create one or several *Invoice Import Configurations*.

This is the same as for the base account_invoice_import.

You can configure a mail gateway to import invoices from an email:

* Go to the menu *Settings > Technical > Email > Incoming Mail Servers* and setup the access (POP or IMAP) to the mailbox that will be used to receive the invoices,
* Unlike the configuration with base account_invoice_import, leave the "create a new record field" empty.
* From the account configuration menu, under journals, link the (purchase) journal to an alias, and in this way set the journal and company_id to use. This way using a catchall domain, you can link multiple email addresses to multiple journals in one or more companies.

Usage
=====

Go to the menu *Invoicing > Vendors > Bills* and then edit a draft bill that has been created from an email.
Use the Import Invoice File button to launch the import. An import definition needs to have been
created for the vendor, or this will not work.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add functionality to determine the partner already from the sender address of the incoming email.
