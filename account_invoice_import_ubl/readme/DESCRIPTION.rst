This module is an extension of the module *account_invoice_import* to add the ability to import UBL XML invoices.
The `UBL (Universal Business Language) <http://ubl.xml.org/>`_ standard is a XML standard for business documents
(invoices, purchase orders, etc...) created by `OASIS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_%28organization%29>`_
(Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards). The UBL standard became the
`ISO/IEC 19845 <http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=66370>`_ standard in December 2015 (cf the
`official announce <http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/01/prweb13186919.htm>_`).

This module works well with `e-fff <http://www.e-fff.be/>`_ invoices as used in Belgium (e-fff invoices are UBL
invoices with an embedded PDF file).
