With module `Account Invoice UBL`, when sending an invoice by mail, only the PDF file is attached to the email and the UBL (XML) file is embedded inside the PDF.

Some accounting software cannot read the embedded XML from a PDF, so the import is only possible by manually generating the XML file.

With this module, when sending an invoice by mail, also the UBL file is automatically included, so that 2 attachments (PDF and XML) are present in the invoice mail.
