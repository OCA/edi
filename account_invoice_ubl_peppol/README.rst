With module `Account Invoice UBL`, invoices are generated according to generic UBL rules.

In Europe, some countries use the PEPPOL 3.0 BIS standard as a more strict subset of UBL.

With this module you can specify some or all of your invoices to be generated and validated
according to this stricter standard.

Configuration
=============

- Go to menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings > Invoicing*, under *Electronic Invoices*.

- Formulate a domain for which invoices the dialect should become PEPPOL.
  By default it is *[]*, so all UBL invoices will be PEPPOL.
  If you want this only for Belgian partners, then you can fill here for example:
  `[('partner_id.country_id.code', '=', 'BE')]`
  Or you can choose to enable this only for selected partner ids.

- You can configure a default tax to use in case an invoice line has no tax specified.
  This is necessary for example in case of an NGO to satisfy business rule
  BR-CO-18. Any tax you choose must also have a UNECE tax type (eg. VAT) and tax
  category (eg. "Services outside scope of tax") defined.

- You can configure a default unit of measure, of which the UNECE code will be used
  in case an invoice line has no unit or product unit. A typical default unit could
  be the Odoo 'unit', configured with a UNECE code of UN, XUN or C62. This is to
  satisfy rule BR-23.

- Go to menu *Contacts*
  Fill the field `coc_registration_number` for your own company's partner record and for
  those partners that you want to send e-invoices to.

- Go to menu *Contacts > Configuration > Localization > Countries*
  On any country relevant for invoice traffic, configure the correct PEPPOL EAS id.
  For the Netherlands, this is for example `0106`, which stands for Dutch chamber of
  commerce number.

- Either: make sure that every invoice has a bank account filled in;
  Or: make sure that your payment modes have a fixed connection to a bank account.
  To do the latter:
  Go to menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Payment mode*
  Per payment model, set the field `bank_account_link` to `fixed`

Usage
=====

In the invoice form click on button `Send & Print`.

If the invoice matches the configured domain for PEPPOL, the invoice will be generated
and validated according to the stricter PEPPOL 3.0 BIS standard.

The validator on https://test.peppolautoriteit.nl/validate can be used to test the
validity of the generated XML file. There are other online validators around as well.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Currently, the user needs to configure the PEPPOL EAS id for each country. For the Netherlands, this is for example `0106`, which stands for Dutch chamber of commerce number. During review, it was noted that (defaults for) these codes could be mapped automatically upon installation of the module, using a post-init hook or a noupdate=1 XML file. This could still be done, saving the perhaps not so tech- or PEPPOL-savvy user some configuration.
* Currently, this module defines allowed EAS codes from a CSV file. But, other modules could also benefit from this data. So the data could be moved to a separate module in the `community-data-files` repository.
* When adding a delivery partner to an invoice, some PEPPOL warnings arise about `DeliveryParty` that should not be included. This is non blocking but it is nice if we could also add a clause in the module to remove this.
* A unit test should be added that actually verifies against PEPPOL and not only against general UBL. This could consist of:

   * Choose a default tax and UoM for this module in `res.config.settings`
   * Create an outgoing invoice on the main company to some partner
   * On the main company's partner record, choose any EU country, set a VAT number and a CoC number
   * On the partner record that is being invoiced, do the same.
   * On the `res.country` records that are being used by these partners, configure a valid PEPPOL EAS code.
   * On both involved partners, configure a bank account.
   * The payment mode that is selected on the invoice should have a `fixed` link to a bank journal.
   * On this bank journal, select a bank account of type `IBAN`.
   * Create a tax and selecting a UNECE tax category (eg. VAT) and a tax type (eg. S)
   * The invoice lines should have this tax defined.
   * Validate the invoice, generate the XML, and pass it through the validator.
* This needs to be tested more thoroughly on credit/refund invoices, and purchase invoices.
* Currently, the module fill in the due date under `PaymentTerms`, but we could prefer the Odoo payment terms field if it is filled.
* Upon clicking Print and Send button on invoice, when an error is encountered, the popup will coincide with the `mail.compose` popup. Improve the UI experience to the user here.
