This is a technical module ; it doesn't bring any useful feature by itself. This module is the base modules for 2 other modules :

* *account_invoice_import* which imports supplier invoices as PDF or XML files (this module also requires some additional modules such as *account_invoice_import_invoice2data*, *account_invoice_import_ubl*, etc... to support specific invoice formats),

* *sale_invoice_import* which imports sale orders as CSV, XML or PDF files (this module also requires some additional modules such as *sale_invoice_import_csv* or *sale_invoice_import_ubl* to support specific order formats)
