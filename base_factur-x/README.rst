This is the base module for the implementation of the Factur-X and `ZUGFeRD <http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/pdfa/zugferd-invoices/>`_ standards. It is a standard based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the Factur-X and ZUGFeRD standards is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice to carry structured information about the invoice.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* go to the menu *Sales > Configuration > Units of Measures* and check the *UNECE Code* for the units of measures that you use in customer invoices/refunds.
* go to the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Taxes > Taxes* and, for each tax that you may use in customer invoices/refunds, set a *UNECE Type Code* and a *UNECE Category Code*.
* go to the menu *Accouting > Configuration > Miscellaneous > Payment Export Types* and assign a *UNECE Code* to the payment types that are selected in the payment modes that you use in customer invoices/refunds.

Usage
=====

This module doesn't do anything by itself, but it is used by 2 other modules:

* account_invoice_factur-x that generate Factur-X/ZUGFeRD 2.0 customer invoices/refunds,
* account_invoice_import_factur-x that imports ZUGFeRD 1.0 and Factur-X/ZUGFeRD 2.0 supplier invoices/refunds.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Rename this module to *base_factur-x* for Odoo 11 (we renamed all modules from *zugferd* to *factur-x* except this one in Odoo 10).
