This is the base module for the implementation of the `Factur-X <http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/>`_ and `ZUGFeRD <https://www.ferd-net.de/zugferd/zugferd-abruf-1.0.html>`_ standards. The standard Factur-X 1.0 is the same as ZUGFeRD 2.0 (the name Factur-X is always used in France, whereas in Germany many people still use the name ZUGFeRD). It is a standard based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the Factur-X/ZUGFeRD standard is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice to carry structured information about the invoice.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* go to the menu *Sales > Configuration > Products > Units of Measures* and check the *UNECE Code* for the units of measures.
* go to the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Taxes* and, for each tax, set a *UNECE Type Code* and a *UNECE Category Code*.
* go to the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Payment Methods* and assign a *UNECE Code* to the payment methods that are selected in the payment modes.

To avoid the manual configuration of taxes, look for a module *l10n_XX_account_tax_unece* in the OCA project of your localization; if such a module exists (it exists at least for the Netherlands and France), install it and it will auto-configure the taxes created by your localization.

Usage
=====

This module doesn't do anything by itself, but it is used by 2 other modules:

* *account_invoice_facturx* that generate Factur-X 1.0 (i.e. ZUGFeRD 2.0) customer invoices/refunds,
* *account_invoice_import_facturx* that imports ZUGFeRD 1.0 and Factur-X 1.0 (i.e. ZUGFeRD 2.0) supplier invoices/refunds.
