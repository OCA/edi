This is the base module for the implementation of the Factur-X and `ZUGFeRD <http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/pdfa/zugferd-invoices/>`_ standards. It is a standard based on `CII <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (Cross-Industry Invoice) for electronic invoicing. The great idea of the Factur-X and ZUGFeRD standards is to embed an XML file inside the PDF invoice to carry structured information about the invoice.
