Base EDI backend.

Provides following models:

1. EDI Backend, to centralize configuration
2. EDI Backend Type, to classify EDI backends (eg: UBL, GS1, e-invoice, pick-yours)
3. EDI Exchange Type, to define file types of exchange
4. EDI Exchange Record, to define a record exchanged between systems

Also define a mixin to be inherited by records that will generate EDIs

Configuration
=============

This module aims to provide an infrastructure to simplify interchangability of documents
between systems providing a configuration platform.
It will be inherited by other modules in order to define the proper implementations of
components.

In order to define a new Exchange Record, we need to configure:

* Backend Type
* Exchange Type
* Backend
* Components

Component definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The component usage must be defined like `edi.{direction}.{kind}.{code}` where:

* direction is `output` or `input`
* kind can be: `generate`, `send`, `check`, `process`, `receive`
* code is the `{backend type code}` or `{backend type code}.{exchange type code}`

User EDI generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the exchange type, it might be possible to define a set of models, a domain and a
snippet of code.
After defining this fields, we will automatically see buttons on the view to generate
the exchange records.
This configuration is useful to define a way of generation managed by user.

Usage
=====

After certain operations or manual execution, Exchange records will be generated.
This Exchange records might be input records or outputs records.

The change of state can be manually executed by the system or be managed through by
`ir.cron`.

Output Exchange records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An output record is intended to be used for exchange information from Odoo to another
system.

The flow of an output record should be:

* Creation
* Generation of data
* Validation of data
* Sending data
* Validation of data processed properly by the other party

Input Exchange records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An input record is intended to be used for exchange information another system to odoo.

The flow of an input record should be:

* Creation
* Reception of data
* Checking data
* Processing data
