Technical module for the EDI suite module to retrieve data for parties of an exchange.

This module provides default component
and a mixin to be used for registering new components for specific backends.

It's based on `partner_identification`
so that the party information will include allowed ID numbers for a given exchange.

You can configure which ID number categories are allowed on the exchange type.
