Configuration
=============

To configure this module you have to belong to the access group 'Voxel
manager' under 'Technical Settings', then:

1. Open a customer form view. In 'Sales & Purchases' page, check 'Enable
   Voxel' if you want to send invoices to this customer through Voxel.
2. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Companies*, open the companies
   you want to enable Voxel communication and set 'Enable Voxel' field
   to True.
3. In the login list, add the corresponding login for connecting with
   Voxel to send the invoices. The final URL where the invoices are
   going to be sent is '<Login URL>/Outbox'.
4. Save the form and edit it again, find 'invoice login' field and
   select the login to be used in the invoice sending.
5. Select also the 'Send mode' to set when the Invoice will be sent:

..

   -  On validate: The invoice will be sent to Voxel automatically when
      the invoice is validated.
   -  At fixed time: The invoice will be sent to Voxel automatically at
      a fixed time.
   -  With delay: The invoice will be sent to Voxel automatically a
      certain time after the invoice is validated.

Note:

This module enqueue the sending invoices to Voxel in jobs in the
background. To do that it uses queue_job module, so a configuration is
required according to that. The jobs for sending invoices to Voxel are
queued in the channel ``root.voxel_export channel``. The sending status
check jobs are queued in the channel ``root.voxel_status``.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Customers > Invoices* and create a new Invoice or
   open an existing draft invoice. Make sure that the customer has
   'Enable Voxel' field checkbox (See configuration section).
2. Validate the invoice and it will be send to Voxel immediately or
   later, depending on the Voxel 'Send mode' chosen in the company
   configuration.
3. A new tab will be visible on the invoice form with the label 'Voxel'
   to show the information regarding sending the invoice to Voxel.
4. When the report is sent, you will be able to see the XML report in
   another tab next to the jobs tab.
