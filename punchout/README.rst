Use Cases / Context
===================

evaluate the module's usefulness in their context. ]

This module set up the base of the connection to a punchout system. Sub
module can be created for example to create a purchase order from a
shopping cart created in the punchout platform. To do this, you can make
your model inherit from "punchout.request" and add the import process by
inheriting "action_process" method.

Linked modules:

-  punchout_environment : allows to configure a punchout backend through
   server environment files
-  punchout_queue_job : link the punchout request to queue jobs,
   automatically call the process method when a response is received
