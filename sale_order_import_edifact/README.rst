Configuration
=============


This module struggles with EDIFACT format, if you need X12 format you will need something like sale_order_import_x12 module.

Regardless format, a concret document should need a concret specification nammed release. For example Amazon uses "D96A" specification.

See <https://www.stedi.com/edi/edifact>

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Move the previews button feature to the base module
