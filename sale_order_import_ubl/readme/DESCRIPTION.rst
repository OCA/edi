This module adds support for the import of electronic RFQ and orders that comply with the `Universal Business Language (UBL) <http://ubl.xml.org/>`_ standard. The UBL standard became the `ISO/IEC 19845 <http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=66370>`_ standard in December 2015 (cf the `official announce <http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/01/prweb13186919.htm>_`). Two file formats are supported by this module:

* UBL XML file,
* PDF file with an embedded UBL XML file.

You can use the OCA module *purchase_order_ubl* to generate RFQs or purchase orders in PDF format with an embedded UBL XML file.
