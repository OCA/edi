This module match products between UBL file and ERP on product screen with these fields:

- `Supplier Product Code` in supplier/procurement page
- `Internal Reference`
- `EAN13`

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* in multicompany environment, we could use `InventoryReportingParty` to guess in which company import data. In this case this xml element should match with the partner linked on company.

* according used keys and their cardinalities many different use cases can be discovered. A subset of these cases are managed. Check unit tests to discover which are. You can add more flows with matching tests.
